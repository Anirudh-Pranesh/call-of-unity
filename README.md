# call-of-unity
my online multiplayer game, made in unity<br/>
unfortunately i have stopped development for this. when shooting, the gun recoils, goes up, but doesnt come down, and the gun just keeps going on like that above the player ðŸ˜¢. try it for yourself.<br/>
i spent so long trying to debug it but couldnt find the issue</br>
</br>
download fps6.zip for the whole source code. you can open it in unity</br>
download build6 to only get the game. run build6.exe

controls : </br>
press 1 for gun</br>
wasd for movement </br>
shift + w for run </br>
there is also another key to set your health to 0 and respawn but i forgot which one it was4
