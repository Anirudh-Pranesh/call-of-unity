# call-of-unity
my online multiplayer game, made in unity<br/>
unfortunately i have stopped development for this. when shooting, the gun recoils, goes up, but doesnt come down, and the gun just keeps going on like that above the player 😢. try it for yourself.<br/>
i spent so long trying to debug it but couldnt find the issue</br>

controls : </br>
press 1 for gun</br>
wasd for movement </br>
